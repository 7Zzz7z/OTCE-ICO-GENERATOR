<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<hr>
<p>1 - You must have <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="blank">Metamask</a> installed, tested with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn" target="blank">Chrome, Firefox, and Opera Extention</a></p>
<p>2 - You must be logged into Metamask : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34&v=6Gf_kRE4MJU" target="blank">Please watch the metamask video</a></p>
<p>3 - You must be connected to one of the "Test Networks" or the "Main Network" : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34&v=6Gf_kRE4MJU" target="blank">Please watch the metamask video</a></p>
<p>4 - We suggest you connect to the "Rinkby Test Network" and test your contract first (cost nothing to test)</p>
<p>5 - You will need to get some "Test Ether" to test your "Test Contract"</p>
<p>6 - After you test your contract then you can connect to the "Main Network" and deploy your final contract</p>
<p>7 - Remember: You will need aprox $15 USD to deploy your final contract on the "Main Network"</p>

<h2>ICO Generator Overview</h2>
<hr>
<p>Blockchain technology, with the application of well-programmed smart contracts, has the capacity to significantly improve control, security and privacy over the exchange of digital assets and information.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is the complexity of writing a smart contract. Smart contracts must be coded in Solidity, a contract-oriented, high-level language that is well known, currently, by just a small percent of developers worldwide. And while that figure is most likely increasing as each month passes, it’s a considerable barrier to entry for the vast majority of the general population of computer users leaving businesses and less computer-savvy individuals marginalized from this new and exciting emerging technology.</p>
<p>A Deloitte survey conducted this year indicated, “Nearly 40 percent of surveyed senior executives still have little or no knowledge about blockchain, while other executives place it among their company’s highest priorities for 2017.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, accessibility to smart contract creation is upon us. The ICO Generator platform, currently nearing the end of its OTCE R-1 token crowdsale, is to smart contract creation what WordPress or Squarespace is to web development.</p>
<p>ICO Generator is, at its core, a smart contract creation tool that will allow any user to create an executable smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. In effect, the ICO Generator platform will enable anyone, even those without any programming or coding experience, to harness the power of distributed computing by making smart contract creation as simple as filling out an online form.</p>
<p>The early version of the platform includes an escrow contract, a token creation contract and a crowdfund contract for users to test and deploy. Once you have deployed a "LIVE" contract there are some additional feature that you can do to work with your contract in this platform:
</br>

<h2>ESCROW</h2>
<hr>
<p>Escrow is when a financial instrument or digital asset is held by a third party on behalf of the other two parties in a transaction. An ICO Generator escrow smart contract takes the traditional legal concept and automates and enforces it via the blockchain, with the terms written and tailored within the digital contract itself. Currency, securities, funds, and other assets can all be held in escrow.</p>
</br>

<h2>TOKEN CREATION</h2>
<hr>
<p>Create an ERC-20 token in mere minutes. An essential, perhaps even foundational element, of any blockchain-based venture is the creation of a unique, digital token. The ICO Generator platform takes the complex development process and condenses it into a simple online form, in a bug-free, fully audited smart contract.</p>
</br>

<h2>CROWDFUND</h2>
<hr>
<p>Compile a token crowdfund contract in just a handful of clicks. What is typically a four- to six-week endeavor is simplified into a single-sitting at the computer with the ICO Generator platform. Develop
ment should not be the main preoccupation of a blockchain project; planning and designing the business model for what lies ahead should be.</p>
<p>The ICO Generator platform will be expanding smart contract options offered to users with a fully-formed suite of templates to choose from. Version 1.0.0 of the platform was made available as of Oct. 1st, 2017 with version 2.0.0 of the platform released in March 2018.</p>
<p>From SEC compliant securities to peer-to-peer wagering, supply chain management, real estate agreements, insurance and more, the ICO Generator platform will offer a wide selection of smart contracts that will range across multiple industries. The OTC ICO Network is powered by the use of its in-app currency, OTCE to run the OTC ICO Platform Network, the platform boast several additional featured services and tools, OTC Coindex, Crypto Directory and the ICO DB. A full list of current and future service can be found at our <a href="https://otcexchange.company" target="blank">corporate website</a>.
